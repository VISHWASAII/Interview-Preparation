✅ If you want to understand all topics clearly, I suggest studying them in a **logical sequence**, because many topics build on earlier ones. Here’s the best order:

### **Step 1: Basics (Foundation)**

- Numbers
    
- Percentage
    
- Ratio and Proportion
    
- Average
    

### **Step 2: Applications of Basics**

- Profit and Loss
    
- Mixture and Alligation
    
- Time and Work
    
- Time Speed Distance
    
- Pipes and Cisterns
    
- Age
    

### **Step 3: Higher Mathematics**

- Algebra
    
- Geometry
    
- Trigonometry, Height, and Distance
    

### **Step 4: Advanced Problem-Solving**

- Probability
    
- Permutation and Combination (PnC)


You listed these topics:

- Profit and Loss
    
- Mixture and Alligation
    
- Time and Work
    
- Time Speed Distance
    
- Pipes and Cisterns
    
- Age
    

👉 To keep it **simple**:  
Most of these topics don’t actually need _extra_ formulas if you already understand the basics like **Percentages, Ratio & Proportion, and Averages**.

Here’s why:

1. **Profit and Loss** → Just uses **percentage** and **basic arithmetic**.
    
2. **Mixture and Alligation** → Based on **average** and **ratio**.
    
3. **Time and Work** → Uses the idea of **rate = work/time**, which is like ratio.
    
4. **Time Speed Distance** → Formula is **Speed = Distance/Time**, very basic.
    
5. **Pipes and Cisterns** → Just like **Time and Work** (rate of filling/emptying).
    
6. **Age** → Uses **linear equations** and **ratio thinking**.
