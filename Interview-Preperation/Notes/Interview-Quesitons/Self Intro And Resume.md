First of all, thank you for this opportunity.  
My name is Sai Vishwa.Im from Tamil Nadu, Vellore and  I completed my Integrated M.Tech in Software Engineering at VIT with a CGPA of 8.20.  
Recently, I completed my internship at Genpact as a Data Engineer, where I worked on technologies such as Spring Boot, React, Docker, and Kubernetes. During my internship, I also contributed to several production applications.

On a personal note, my father is a goldsmith, my mother is a homemaker, and my sister is a dentist.

## What projects you worked on?

During my internship, I worked on a **Software Ticket Management System** using **Java Spring Boot** and **React.js**.  
It was a **microservices application** with four services — **User, Admin, Manager, and Infosec**.

I used **Apache Kafka** and the **Saga choreography pattern** to handle communication between the services.  
When a user sends a software request, it goes to the Admin, then the Manager, and finally to Infosec for approval.  
If anyone rejects the request, the system automatically rolls back the previous actions.

This project helped me learn **microservices, Kafka, and handling distributed transactions**.
