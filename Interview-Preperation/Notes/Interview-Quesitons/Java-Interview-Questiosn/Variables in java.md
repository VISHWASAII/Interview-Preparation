## 1 - What is Variable?

```
it is container which holdes a value
```

- Types of Datatypes?

```
There are two types of variable 
One -- is primitive datatype
Second -- is Non - primitive/ Reference Type
```

## 2 - What all are the Primitive Datatypes

```
There are 3 types of Primitive datatypes

Integral Types
[char, byte, short, int, long]

Fractional Types
[Float, double]

Boolean Types
[Boolean]
```

 ## 3 - What is non primitive Datatype?
**Non-primitive data types** (also called **reference types**) **store the reference (or memory address) of the actual data**, not the data itself.

Here are the **types of non-primitive data types**:

1. Arrays
    
2. Classes
    
3. Objects
    
4. Strings
    
5. Interfaces
    
6. Collections (e.g., List, Set, Map)

## 4 - Wrapper class
A **wrapper class** in Java is a **class that encapsulates a primitive data type** into an **object**. This allows primitive values to be treated as objects when needed, for example, when working with collections like `ArrayList` that can only store objects.

## 5 - Global vs Local variables
